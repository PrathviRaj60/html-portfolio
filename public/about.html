<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I am Prathviraj and am currently a student in Bangalore Institute of Technology, doing my major in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
  My native being Koteshwara of Udupi district is where i have completed most of my education in.
I completed my tenth in Sri Siddhivinayaka Residential School located in Hattiangady, and my PU in Viveka PU college, Kota.
</p>

<p>I have my technical skills in C, Python, PowerBI and am currently seeking to grow my knowledge in the field of web developmenmt and hence this portfolio.</p>

<p>I am fascinated about reading and writing books, which is now a hobby of mine alongside listening to music and drawing sketches.
  I'm not particularly a picky eater but i hate raddish and brinjal, by the way, i absolutely love lettuce,whoppers,coffee,cheese and more;guess i broke out of the category there, my bad.
  Well then, that's all. Thank you.
